multiple assignment


general functions:
print
type
len

sorted
all
any
max
min
bin
input



Operators:
arithmetic:
+	add
-	subtract

0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8
-9	-8	-7	-6	-5	-4	-3	-2	-1
	
“text data”
indexing
	negative indexing
	slicing 
		substring
		upper index excluded
		no errors on index out of bounds
	immutable
	
escape sequences:
\n	newline
\t	tab
\r	return
\f	form feed
\v	vertical tab

string functions:
	
	
Data Structures:
Lists
	ordered
heterogeneous data
	allows duplicate data
indexing
	negative indexing
	slicing 
		upper index excluded
		no errors on index out of bound
mutable
nesting
functions:
	sort, reverse, append, remove…..

tuple
	ordered
heterogeneous data
	allows duplicate data
indexing
	negative indexing
	slicing 
		upper index excluded
		no errors on index out of bound
tuples by themselves are immutable
members can be mutable
nesting
functions:
	index, count
	
sets
	unordered
	no duplicates
no indexing
	no slicing 
	sets by themselves are mutable
members have to be immutable
functions:
	add, intersection, union

dictionary
	pair of key:value
unordered
indexing is with the key
	no slicing 
	dictionary by themselves are mutable
keys:
have to be immutable
no duplicates
values:
	mutable
	duplicates allowed
nesting
functions:
	

modules:
1.	import mamatha

2.	from mamatha import red, pink
red()
white()

3.	from mamatha import *
red()

pink()

4.	import mamatha as m
m.red()
m.white()
m.pink()

5.	from mamatha import red as r
